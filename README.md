### HeadsUpper

This is your own version of the Ellen Degeneres classic, Heads Up! If you're unfamiliar with the game, please refer to the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_ezpX7DwY

**Requirements**

This app consists of no fewer that 2 screens. The first screen will hold a list of game topics. The second screen is the game screen. When the user selects a topic, they should ultimately end up on the game screen. The game screen needs, at minimum, the following things:
1) a timer 
2) a list of clues 
3) a way for the user to signify whether they guess correctly, or they want to skip. 

When the timer is up, the app should let the user know how many answers they got right (eg. 3/8). 
The user should be able to play as many games as they'd like without having to quit the app.
